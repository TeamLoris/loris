I've now lowered that to 8192, and set the activitypub logging to debugging to get queue stats. `RUST_LOG=\"warn,lemmy_server=warn,lemmy_api=warn,lemmy_api_common=warn,lemmy_api_crud=warn,lemmy_apub=warn,lemmy_db_schema=warn,lemmy_db_views=warn,lemmy_db_views_actor=warn,lemmy_db_views_moderator=warn,lemmy_routes=warn,lemmy_utils=warn,lemmy_websocket=warn,activitypub_federation=debug\"`\n\nAlso, I saw that there were many workers retrying to servers that are unreachable. So, I've blocked some of these servers:\n\n```\ncommallama.social,mayheminc.win,lemmy.name,lm.runnerd.net,frostbyrne.io,be-lemmy.org,lemmonade.marbledfennec.net,lemmy.sarcasticdeveloper.com,lemmy.kosapps.com,pawb.social,kbin.wageoffsite.com,lemmy.iswhereits.at,lemmy.easfrq.live,lemmy.friheter.com,lmy.rndmm.us,kbin.korgen.xyz\n```\n\nThis gave good results, way less active workers, so less timeouts. (I see that above 3000 active workers, timeouts start).\n\n(If you own one of these servers, let me know once it's back up, so I can un-block it)\n\nNow it's after midnight so I'm going to bed. Surely more troubleshooting will follow tomorrow and in the weekend.\n\nPlease let me know if you see improvements, or have many issues still.","creator_id":2,"community_id":5,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-29T22:02:48.679936","updated":null,"deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":null,"embed_description":null,"embed_video_url":null,"thumbnail_url":null,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/818810","local":true,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"creator":{"id":2,"name":"ruud","display_name":"Ruud","avatar":"https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/2f75baeb-34c1-4a8b-8d1e-bc0a52b47a62.png","banned":false,"published":"2023-06-01T07:01:45.388375","updated":null,"actor_id":"https://lemmy.world/u/ruud","bio":"Admin of a lot of fediverse servers, among which the .world ones:\n- lemmy.world\n- mastodon.world\n- calckey.world\n\nYou can find me on these servers as @ruud\n\nI receive a lot of messages, direct and mentions.

This is obviously another point in favor of defederating them, assuming you are worried about botswarms, which is currently being discussed [here.](https://sh.itjust.works/post/559248)\n\nMy advice to you all is please try to discuss this in a civil manner, we need not allow them to create divisive conflict inside our communities. No matter how the vote turns out, you're not going to be able to defederate from your fellow sh.itheads so be nice.\n\nI've linked many of the previous discussions below so people who are out of the loop can get a general sense of the situation.\n\nhttps://sh.itjust.works/post/216888\nhttps://sh.itjust.works/post/225714\nhttps://sh.itjust.works/post/281126\nhttps://sh.itjust.works/post/410325\n\nLemmy.world just recently defederated them.\n\nhttps://lemmy.world/post/747912\n\nhttps://lemmy.world/post/577526\n\nAlthough this could be considered a point in favor of defederation, it actually means even if we vote to remain federated, people have a great alternative in lemmy.world where they can still participate in our communities and simultaneously be protected from exploding-heads. \n\nEnsuring diversity of servers is beneficial to the platform as a whole, but it is also not our responsibility to bear that burden.\n\nTLDR, just wrap up any last points in this thread before we open the vote tomorrow. Please be civil.\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify, this isn't the official vote, this is the final discussion. The vote thread will be posted tomorrow and you will only be allowed to make a single comment saying Aye or Nay.\n\nEDIT2: \nVote thread is up, this thread is now locked.
